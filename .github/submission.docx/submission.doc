	Impact: This milestone improved code readability, maintainability, and reduced the complexity of programming, laying the foundation for modern software development.
2.	Introduction of the Waterfall Model (1970s):
	Description: The Waterfall Model, introduced by Dr. Winston W. Royce, was one of the first formalized software development methodologies, emphasizing a sequential design process with distinct phases.
	Impact: Although later criticized for its rigidity, the Waterfall Model introduced the concept of software development life cycles, which remains a fundamental idea in software engineering.
3.	The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001):
	Description: The Agile Manifesto was introduced, promoting iterative development, customer collaboration, and adaptability to change.
	Impact: Agile transformed how software is developed, enabling faster delivery of features, better alignment with customer needs, and improved responsiveness to changing requirements.

Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
1.	Requirement Analysis:
	Description: In this phase, the needs and requirements of the users and stakeholders are gathered, analysed, and documented. The goal is to understand what the software should do and what constraints must be considered.

2.	Design:
	Description: Based on the requirements, the system’s architecture and design are created. This phase involves defining the software’s structure, components, interfaces, and data models.
3.	Implementation:
	Description: The design is translated into source code in this phase. Developers write the code according to the design specifications, and the software is built.
4.	Testing:
	Description: The developed software is thoroughly tested to identify and fix any bugs or issues. This phase ensures that the software meets the required standards and functions as expected.
5.	Deployment:
	Description: Once the software is tested and ready, it is deployed to a production environment where it can be used by end-users. This phase may also include final adjustments and optimizations.
6.	Maintenance:
	Description: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored for performance, and any issues that arise are resolved. This phase also includes updates and enhancements to the software over time.

Comparison of Waterfall and Agile Methodologies
Waterfall Methodology:
	Overview: The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to software development. Each phase must be completed before moving to the next, and it typically follows the order of Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance.

	Pros:
o	Predictability: The structure makes it easier to plan and estimate timelines and costs.
o	Documentation: Detailed documentation is created at each phase, which can be useful for understanding and maintaining the system.

	Cons:
o	Inflexibility: Changes are difficult and costly once the project is in later stages.
o	Late Testing: Testing occurs late in the process, which may lead to discovering issues when they are harder to address.

	Appropriate Scenarios:
o	Well-Defined Projects: Projects with clear, unchanging requirements, such as regulatory software or projects with strict compliance needs.
o	Fixed Scope: When the scope and requirements are clearly defined and unlikely to change.

Agile Methodology:
	Overview: Agile is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. Development is divided into small cycles called sprints or iterations, with frequent reassessments and adjustments.

	Pros:
o	Flexibility: Allows for changes and refinements based on feedback throughout the development process.
o	Customer Engagement: Regular feedback ensures that the product is aligned with user needs and expectations.

	Cons:
o	Less Predictability: Time and costs can be harder to estimate due to iterative changes.

Prompt Engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts (inputs or queries) to effectively interact with AI models, especially those based on natural language processing (NLP). The goal of prompt engineering is to craft prompts that guide AI models to produce the desired outputs or responses. This involves understanding how the model interprets different inputs and optimizing prompts to improve the quality and relevance of the AI's responses.
Importance of Prompt Engineering in Interacting with AI Models
1.	Enhanced Model Performance:
	Explanation: Well-crafted prompts can significantly improve the accuracy and relevance of the AI model's responses. By providing clear and specific instructions, prompt engineering helps the model understand the context and intent, leading to better outcomes.
2.	Customization and Control:
	Explanation: Prompt engineering allows users to tailor the behaviour of AI models to meet specific needs or preferences. By designing prompts strategically, users can influence the tone, style, and content of the AI's responses.
3.	Efficient Use of AI Capabilities:
	Explanation: Effective prompts can help users leverage the full capabilities of AI models without needing deep technical expertise. By understanding how to frame prompts, users can achieve more accurate and useful results from the AI.
4.	Minimizing Misunderstandings:
	Explanation: Proper prompt engineering helps reduce ambiguities and misunderstandings that can occur when interacting with AI models. Clear and precise prompts reduce the likelihood of receiving irrelevant or incorrect responses.
5.	Testing and Iteration:
	Explanation: Prompt engineering involves iterative testing and refinement to determine which prompts produce the best results. This process helps in continuously improving interactions with the AI model.

Example of a vague prompt: “Tell me about civil engineering.”
Improved version: “Give a brief overview in the major milestones in the history of civil engineering field.”
The improved prompts help to reduce ambiguities and misunderstandings that can occur when interacting with AI models. Clear and precise prompts reduce the likelihood of receiving irrelevant or incorrect responses.
